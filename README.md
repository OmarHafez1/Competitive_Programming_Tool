**Hello**, I would like to introduce The **Competitive Programming tool**. It provides several useful features for competitive programmers.

# **Test your code for testCases:**
You can test your code for several test cases at the same time and you can load the test cases supplied in the problem automatically just by paste the link of the problem in the tool and let it load the test cases for you (This work for Codeforces, Atcoder)

# **Submit your solution:** 
This tool can also submit your solution automatically to your account from the tool itself and load the results of your submission (Accepted, Wrong answer, ..etc) 
(This work for [codeforces.com](codeforces.com) and [atcoder.jp](atcoder.jp))

# **Save you solutions:**
This will take a copy of your solution and save it in a folder with a name depending on the link of the problem
And this process happens automatically once your submission gets **Accepted**.
This feature may be useful for some users

# **Nice colorful output section:**
Nice detailed output section that explains where exactly your error in the code and also gives you feedback about the time and memory taken by your code for each test case

# **Encrypt your username and password:**
This tool will Encrypt your username and password and store them. (This process is needed to log in into your accounts to submit your solution)

# **Works for C++, Python, and Java:**  
I will add to it in the future some other programming language.

# **How to use it:**
You will need to put your code files in the CODE folder. (in CODE folder you will find C++ folder, Java folded, and Python folder to put your code in them) 
Then write the name of your file down right textBox (without the extension of the file i.e. A not A.cpp or A.java or A.py just A)

Then chose the language that you use from the upper right ComboBox. 

to submit, save or load test cases, press F1 (Please make sure to take a look at the shortcuts.txt file that contain all the shortcuts in it)

# **Installation:**
There is no need to install anything just download [this](https://www.mediafire.com/file/7kl5s1c9yy9wg3z/Competitive_Programming.zip/file) folder and double-click on the Competitive_Programming.jar file to open it! 
This program is written in Java so please make sure to have java installed on your machine. 
And also please make sure that you have Chrome browser installed and updated.

_**If you faced "An error occurred" when submitting your solution please check the version of your chrome browser and then go to this [website](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and download the chrome driver of your chrome browser version (This just about 7 MB only) then replace the file chromedriver in src folder (or chromedriver.exe for windows) with the new one**_

**UPDATE: 2021/10/04** I updated the fonts with better fonts. Please make sure to install the fonts used from the folder *"FONTS TO INSTALL"* before starting the program. 


**UPDATE: 2021/10/11** Simple bugs fixed. The bug makes the program unable to load the results when submitting to atcoder for the first time for the contest. And the bug that makes it unable to submit a solution to codeforces once you change the programming language that you use.


**Please don't remove or rename any file or folder (except the code files in the CODE folder).**

# **[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/7kl5s1c9yy9wg3z/Competitive_Programming.zip/file)** (last update 2021/10/11)

**This Tool work for Linux(Ubuntu) and Windows**

# **Copyrights**
There are no copyrights on it so you can update it and make your own version and share it (for free) with the community but please don't forget to mention me in it. 

Hope you find this useful. Thanks a lot for reading.
